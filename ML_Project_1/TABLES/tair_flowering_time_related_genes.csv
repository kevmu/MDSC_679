Gene:1005715629	AT1G04400	AT1G04400.2	protein_coding	Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.

Mainly expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons, leaves and hypocotyls, but also in stomata. Localized to the nucleus and acts as a repressor of CONSTANS through binding to the Dof binding sites in the CO promoter. Protein gets degraded by FKF1 in the afternoon. CDF1 binds to the TOPLESS co-repressor protein through an N-terminal motif which is conserved across CDF-like proteins throughout land-plants. This interaction is important for the repression of CO and FT genes during the morning. Loss of CDF1 dependent repression through omission of TPL coordinating residues or through the loss of TPL function in phloem companion cells results in early flowering due to an up regulation of FT.

Gene:2018253	AT1G04400	AT1G04400.1	protein_coding	Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.

This modification alters the expression of the target genes (i.e. FLC, MAF4, MAF6).  Incorporation of this variant histone into chromatin mediates the ambient temperature response. Located at specific regions of the nuclear periphery. Expression throughout plants shown by in-situ and immunolocalization methods.

It is localized to the inner surface of the nuclear envelope and is a component of the nuclear pore-associated steps of sumoylation and mRNA export in plants.  Mutations affect flowering time regulation and other developmental processes.  Probably acts in the same pathway as ESD4 in affecting flowering time, vegetative and inflorescence development.

Gene:2082617	AT3G57230	AT3G57230.1	protein_coding	MADS-box transcription factor. Expressed in leaf, root and stem, with higher RNA accumulation in guard cells and trichomes. AGL16 can directly interact with SVP and indirectly interact with FLC. Furthermore, the accumulation of AGL16 transcripts is modulated by miR824 (AT4G24415). The flowering time effect for the miR824/AGL16 module is more obvious in the Col-FRI background than in the Col-0 background. AGL16 controls flowering via a allelic dosage effect in long-day non-vernalized conditions.
